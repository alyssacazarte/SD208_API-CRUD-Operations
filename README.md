# SD208_API-CRUD-Operations
For your asynchronous task today, create an API that will perform the basic CRUD operations. This API is for a note taking app and will be required to have the following fields:

- id (auto-generated)
- note title
- description

There should be 5 endpoints for the API
- get all notes
- get one note
- create note
- delete note
- update note (updates the title and description)

You don't need to use a database yet. Just use a list in your API that would represent the database

Addition1: 

*Insert a Validation

Addition2:

*Validate fields for createNotesDto

*Create a filter DTO for get all endpoint

*Query parameters - search and status

*Must return a list based on the query parameters

*If query params are not used, it should return all

*Create a custom pipe to validate the status field in the request body of update endpoint

Addition3:

*TypeORM and MySQL
