# SD208_API-CRUD-Operations
For your asynchronous task today, create an API that will perform the basic CRUD operations. This API is for a note taking app and will be required to have the following fields:

- id (auto-generated)
- note title
- description

There should be 5 endpoints for the API
- get all notes
- get one note
- create note
- delete note
- update note (updates the title and description)
Addition: Insert a Validation

You don't need to use a database yet. Just use a list in your API that would represent the database
